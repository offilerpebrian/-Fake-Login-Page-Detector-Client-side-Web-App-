# 🛡️ Phishing Login Page Detector (Frontend)

A simple web-based tool that analyzes URLs to detect potential phishing login pages.

## Features
- Runs 100% on client-side (HTML + JS)
- Detects suspicious patterns (IP address, subdomains, keywords)

## How to Use
Open `index.html` in your browser and enter a URL to analyze.

> Note: This tool uses static rules and is for learning only. Real detection requires more advanced heuristics and server validation.
